# ADAP-3D_V2

ADAP-BIG-V2 is a software that detects peaks in mass spectrometry data using object detection and image processing through the YOLOv5 algorithm and preprocessing blocking methods.

## Installation

CD to the folder with requirements.txt and run this command in the terminal:

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
python adap_3d_main.py
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5
```

## Adjust Parameters

Navigate to params.py in the adap-3d-cli directory and adjust parameters in this module

## Results

YoloV5 inferences stored in the cloned repo runs folder.

Exports one `.csv` file to user specified `results path` (user can specify in `params.py`) containing:
  - Block # peak is located in
  - M/Z value of peak
  - Retention Time value of peak
  - M/Z and Retention Time ranges
  - Confidence of model on specified peak
